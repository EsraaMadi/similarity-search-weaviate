This is an application spins up a [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/)  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Weaviate_logo_%28no_text%29.svg/1280px-Weaviate_logo_%28no_text%29.svg.png" width="30" height="25" /> instance to search for similar products across the market. This could help stores to know if their products was also in their competitorâ€™s offering. The app use [62k images of products](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kuchhbhi/stylish-product-image-dataset) combined with their text description to build vectors for the data we intend to search.

## How to run with your own custom images

<br/>

> Prerequisites to run it yourself
- [Docker & Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/compose-desktop/)

<br/>
<br/>

*Then follow steps below:*

<br/>

1. Clone the repository in your local machine

<p align="center">
  <img width="800" height="500" src="data/repo%20pics/step1.gif">
</p>

Your local repository would contain sub folder `data` with the following structure:

```
data/
|__images/
|    |__(Should contains images files)
|
|__text/
|    |__(Should contains CSV file for description text)
|
|__repo pics/
|    | (ignore this folder)
```
- Hint: create `data/images`, `data/text` folders if they are not exist (git repository does not keep empty folders)

<br/>
<br/>

2. Add your images to the `data/images` folder with any format (`png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`)

<p align="center">
  <img width="412" height="500" src="data/repo%20pics/step2.gif">
</p>

<br/>
<br/>

3. Add your sheet that has description text of all image to the `data/text` folder
    - Hint:
        - The current script accepts only csv file (you can change it to accept excel files from script `import-data.py`)
        - The csv file should has at least 2 columns:
            - `id`: image name.
            -  `title`: text description for image.

</p>


  **Note:** if you would like to use the same images used here in this demo --> use the terminal to navigate in local repository folder then run following command in the terminal:

  ``` console
  make download
  ```
  this command will download around 62k images (~10 GB) as zip file, unzip the downloaded file and paste images as we did in step 3 & 4

  <br/>
  <br/>

4. Start up Weaviate and import images to the vector database using following command:
``` console
make setup
```

5. To run the streamlit app, open for your browser at `http://localhost:8084`
