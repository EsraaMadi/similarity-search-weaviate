This is an application spins up a [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/) instance to search for similar products across the market. This could help stores to know if their products was also in their competitorâ€™s offering. The app use [62k images of products](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kuchhbhi/stylish-product-image-dataset) combined with their text description to build vectors for the data we intend to search.

</p>

Your local repository would contain `data` subfolder with following structure:

```
data/
|__images/
|    |__(Should contains images files)
|
|__text/
|    |__(Should contains CSV file for image description text)
|
|__repo pics/
|    | (ignore this folder)
```

2. Add your images to the `data/images` folder with any format (png, jpg, jpeg )

3. Add your sheet that has description text of all image to the `data/text` folder
    - Hint:
        - The current script accept csv file.
        - The csv file should has at least 2 columns (`id`: image name, `title`: text description for image)
